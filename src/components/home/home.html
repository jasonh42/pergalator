        <h1>What's a PERG?</h1>
        <p>Pandora encourages all employees to collaborate and socialize with Pandora Employee Resource Groups (PERGs).  Employee Groups are voluntary, employee driven groups that are organized around a particular shared interest. We encourage motivated employees to initiate their own PERG. Each one should reflect our culture and preserve the spirit of Pandoraâ€™s Principles. PERGs should be inclusive to all staff participation and promote socialization through a shared interest or hobby. Pandora will provide each group with 5 people or more a $1000 allowance to use toward expenses to help support their efforts. Get involved!
